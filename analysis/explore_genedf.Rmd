## Setup
### Clean workspace, set options, load data
```{r start clean and load data}
rm(list=ls())
options(stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
genedf = readRDS("data/genedf.rds")
```
In `genedf`, each row is a gene and each column is a different attribute.
```{r}
rownames(genedf)[1:5]
names(genedf)[1:5]
```
Look at the dimensions of `genedf` and the first few rows.
```{r}
dim(genedf)
genedf[1:5, ]
```

## Subsetting to specific genes
### One gene of interest
#### Set a specific gene name
This should be the official _A. burtoni_ gene symbol. Here we will use the androgen receptor gene _ar_.
```{r}
xgene = "ar"
```
#### Is the gene present at all in `genedf`, if so, where?
`genedf$geneSym` accesses the column in `genedf` that has the name `geneSym`, which holds the official _A. burtoni_ gene symbols.
There are other ways to access columns in a data frame, but I prefer `$` notation because it's explicit.
```{r}
genedf$geneSym[1:5]
```
`genedf$geneSym == xgene` creates a vector of logical/boolean values testing whether values in `genedf$geneSym` are equal to the value in `xgene`. Entry _i_ corresponds to row _i_ in `genedf`.
```{r}
xgeneLogicalVec = genedf$geneSym == xgene
xgeneLogicalVec[1:5]
```
When a vector containing logical/boolean values is large we may want to test: 
1. Whether any entries are `TRUE` 
2. The exact locations of any entries that are `TRUE`
```{r}
# Note that the length of xgeneLogicalVec is the same as the number of rows in genedf
length(xgeneLogicalVec)
# Are any entries in xgeneLogicalVec TRUE?
xgenePres = any(xgeneLogicalVec)
xgenePres
# Which entries are TRUE?
xgeneRow = which(xgeneLogicalVec)
xgeneRow
```
Here are multiple equivalent ways to access the row in `genedf` containing information for the gene whose name is stored in `xgene`.
```{r}
# Use the logical vector 
genedf[xgeneLogicalVec, ]
genedf[genedf$geneSym == xgene, ]
# Use the row number
genedf[xgeneRow, ]
# Use the subset() function, which effectively creates a logical vector equivalent to xgeneLogicalVec on the fly, then uses is to subset the data frame
subset(genedf, geneSym == xgene)
```
